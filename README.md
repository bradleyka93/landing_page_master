# jQuery Landing Page

- For this project we will be using the attached front end to enhance it with jQuery.

- Step 1: Add the class "affix" to the nav element when the scroll distance reaches past 50 pixels.

.addClass()
.scrollTop()

var scrollDistance = $(window).scrollTop();

if statement - if the scroll distance is greater than 50, go ahead and add the class of affix, if not, remove the class of affix

DONE!

- Step 2: When the navbar links are clicked, animate a page scroll down to that anchor.

.attr ()
reference last week's lab - smooth scroll

DONE!

- Step 3: Use Bootstrap scrollspy to change the navbar links on scroll.

Go into the navigation in HTML and target

DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS NOT WORKING!

- Step 4: Implement Font Awesome icons where applicable.

DONE!


- Step 5: Use [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) and [WOW JS](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW) to fade in elements of your choice on page scroll.

Would recommend that we use WOW JS
Make sure to add the line to the JavaScript file
